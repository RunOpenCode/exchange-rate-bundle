Configuration
=============

Configuration of this bundle is possible by using both `.yml` and `.xml`
(recommended) configuration file. In case that you use an `.xml` file format
for configuration, please reffer to provided [XMLSchema](../src/RunOpenCode/Bundle/ExchangeRate/Resources/config/schema/configuration-1.0.0.xsd)
within your IDE tool.

In order for this bundle to successfully be utilized, at least one source
for exchange rates must be included in project. For details about exchange
rate sources, please see relevant [section](sources.md) of this documentation.
For the sake of the simplicity, we will preasume in this chapter that source

is installed as well.
